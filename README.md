### Problem Statement

I currently have a very large music CD collection that I have been accumulating for almost 30 years.  They are all organized 
in a CD case sorted alphabetically by group/artist name.  Also, they are all loaded in iTunes.  However, iTunes is limited
in its ability to search and list the data.  This makes it difficult to get a good overall picture of my music CD collection.

I would like to create a website that people could use to organize, list and view their music CD collection.  It would contain
similar information to iTunes, but with a better interface for searching and listing the data.  I would also
like to give the users of this website the ability to lend and borrow CDs between friends and family that also use the 
website.
